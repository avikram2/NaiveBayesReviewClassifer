# NaiveBayesReviewClassifer
Project for INFO 490 MH2 class at UIUC.  

The problem to be solved is whether the sentiment of a review (positive or negative review) can be predicted based on the words that are used in the review. In other words, the goal of the project is to see if a Naive Bayes classifier can be developed that can accurately classify the sentiment of a review, based on the words present in the review.



The code for the project, as well as the explanation, is in a Google Collab Notebook: the Final_Project.ipnynb file in the repo.
